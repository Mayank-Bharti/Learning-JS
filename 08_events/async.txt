-> Default JS => Synchronous
    |--> Single threaded

-> Execution context
       |-->execute one line of a code at a time.
       |-->console log -> 1
       |--> console log -> 2
       |--> CALL STACK   MEMORY HEAP
       |--> each operation waits for the last one to complete 
            before executing
-> Blocking code: Block the flow of program -> Read file Sync.
-> Non blocking code: Does not block execution-> read file Async

Some time blocking better and sometime non blocking. It depend on use case. E.g registration of user, while reading file we sent success message but there is error while reading , so here non blocking code fails , so in this use case, we write blocking code.
