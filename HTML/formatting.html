<!-- Reading docs:

<b>  → This tag is used to make text look bold, but it does not mean the text is important — it is just for styling.
Use <b> when:
1. we want to make some text stand out visually.
2. The bold text is not important, just styled to catch the readers eye.
Examples:
1. Highlighting product names:
2. Buy the new <b>iPhone 15</b> now!
3. Making keywords bold in a summary:This article covers <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>JavaScript</b>.

Use other tags when you need to show meaning, not just style:

<strong> → for important text. The <strong> HTML element indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency.Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.

<em> → for emphasis. The <em> HTML element marks text that has stress emphasis. The <em> element can be nested, with each level of nesting indicating a greater degree of emphasis.

<mark> → for highlighting relevant info. The <mark> HTML element represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation purposes due to the marked passage's relevance in the enclosing context.

<h1> to <h6> → for headings. The <h1> to <h6> HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest. By default, all heading elements create a block-level box in the layout, Appearance:- starting on a new line and taking up the full width available in their containing block.Look bolder and bigger (depending on the number: <h1> is biggest, <h6> is smallest)

Best practices:1. start from h1 and go down in order i.e. h2, h3 etc.
2. Do not skip levels like jumping h1 to h3.
3. Use only h1 per page (main title)
4. Donot use heading just to make text bigger. Use CSS Font size property for that.

For Screen Readers (Visually Impaired Users)
1. People use headings to navigate quickly.
2. If you skip levels, it confuses them (e.g., if there’s <h1> then <h3>, they wonder what happened to <h2>).
3. Screen readers can list all headings so people can jump to what they want.

"Nesting" means putting headings inside other sections.It Helps readers and screen reader users understand how the content is organized
Screen readers can list all headings so users can jump to the section they want.

Now there are multiple sections like 2 nav bars, then screen readers may confused.Then we label sections using aria-labelledby and id.

For screen readers:
They will announce:"Main Navigation", "Footer Navigation". So users know the purpose of each section — they don’t need to guess!

-->

<!-- Example of main nav and footer nav: -->
<header>
  <nav aria-labelledby="main-nav">
    <h2 id="main-nav">Main Navigation</h2>
    <!-- menu items -->
  </nav>
</header>

<footer>
  <nav aria-labelledby="footer-nav">
    <h2 id="footer-nav">Footer Navigation</h2>
    <!-- footer links -->
  </nav>
</footer>

<!-- 
<i>     → The <i> tag is used when we want to show that a part of our text is different from normal text — like:
A thought, A technical term,A foreign word,A scientific name, A ship name,idiomatic text,, taxonomical designations,Alternative voice or mood,Transliterations,Ship or vessel names in Western writing systems, etc.
This text is usually shown in italics by the browser.

Use <i> for text that:
->Is not part of the main flow of the sentence.
->Has a different meaning or voice.
->Isn’t strong or important enough for <strong> or <em>.
-> Use <i> when the meaning or style of the text is semantically different, not just to make it look pretty.For appearance use css span or in HTML span element.

  Example of span of css and span HTML element:
  span {
  font-style: italic;
}

-->
  <p>This is <span>italic text</span> using CSS.</p>

  <!-- Example for <i></i> use case: -->
 <p>I thought <i>This is amazing!</i></p>
<!-- A thought -->

<p>The genus <i>Panthera</i> includes lions and tigers.</p>
<!-- Scientific name -->

<p>Bandwidth is a technical term: <i>bandwidth</i>.</p>
<!-- Technical term -->

<p>I love the Italian phrase <i lang="it">bella ciao</i>.</p>
<!-- Foreign phrase -->

<!-- In earlier versions of the HTML specification, the <i> element was merely a presentational element used to display text in italics.This is no longer true, as these tags now define semantics rather than typographic appearance. A browser will typically still display the contents of the <i> element in italic type, but is, by definition, no longer required to do so. To display text in italic type, authors should use the CSS font-style property. -->
  
<!-- 
<sub>   → The <sub> HTML element specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text.
It is used for footnote numbers,mathematical variable numbers,Denoting the number of atoms of a given element within a chemical formula, etc.

<sup>   → The <sup> HTML element specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text. It is used for displaying exponents,
Representing ordinal numbers, such as "4th",Displaying superior lettering, which is used in some languages when rendering certain abbreviations. For example, in French, the word "mademoiselle" can be abbreviated "Mlle".

<small> → The <small> HTML element represents side-comments and small print — text that isn’t the main message but still important, like copyright and legal text/disclaimers,Terms and conditions, independent of its styled presentation. By default, it renders text within it one font-size smaller than normal text, such as from small to x-small.
Even though <small> looks smaller, it’s not just for styling — it tells the browser and developers:
"This is a side note or secondary info."
For styling, we use span tag of html and fontsize property of css.
Example of small tag:
-->
<p>This is my website.</p>
<p><small>© 2025 All rights reserved.</small></p>
<!-- 
Example for styling :

.tiny {
  font-size: 0.8em;
} 
-->

<p>This is <span class="tiny">tiny text</span>.</p>
<ins>mayank</ins><del>bharti</del>

<!--
<del>   → What is <del>?
The <del> tag is used to show text that was deleted from a document.
->Browsers usually show this with a line through the text (strikethrough).
->It is helpful when showing changes, like in:
->Edited articles
->Code differences
->Track changes in documents
Use it when:
->we want to show what content has been removed.
->we're making changes visible to the user.
->we’re showing revisions, like old prices or incorrect statements.

Example:
<p>This phone used to cost <del>$799</del> <ins>$699</ins>.</p>

Example with attributes:
<del cite="https://example.com/meeting-notes" datetime="2025-06-22T14:00:00Z">
  Old pricing plan
</del>

-> Don’t use <del> just for strikethrough appearance.
-> Use it only when we really mean that something was removed for a reason.
-> To just style text with a line through, use CSS: <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Old text</span>
-> The presence of the del element is not announced by most screen reading technology in its default configuration. It can be made to be announced by using the CSS content property, along with the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements.

del with special css property along with the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements:

del::before {
  content: " [deletion start] ";
}

del::after {
  content: " [deletion end] ";
}

/* Plus this to hide visually */
del::before,
del::after {
  position: absolute;
  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
  white-space: nowrap;
  height: 1px;
  width: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
}

<ins> → The <ins> element can be used for the opposite purpose: to indicate text that has been added to the document.

cite attribute→	A link to the reason or source of the change (e.g., meeting notes).

datetime attribute→	The date and time when the text was deleted. Must be in valid format. This attribute indicates the time and date of the change and must be a valid date string with an optional time. If the value cannot be parsed as a date with an optional time string, the element does not have an associated timestamp.

→  What is style in HTML?
The style global attribute allows we to add CSS styles directly to an HTML element.
It changes how an element looks, such as:Background color,Font size,Alignment,Margins, padding, etc.
It controls appearance, not meaning.Use it sparingly — prefer external or internal CSS for real projects(full websites).
Good for quick tests or small changes.

Why?
It’s easier to manage, reuse, and update CSS when it’s separate from HTML.

-->
<!-- Example of style tag in HTML elements: -->

<div style="background: #ffe7e8; border: 2px solid #e66465">
  <p style="margin: 15px; line-height: 1.5; text-align: center">
    Well, I am the slime from your video<br />
    Oozin' along on your livin' room floor.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- →  Global attributes in HTML are attributes that can be applied to any HTML element, regardless of its type. These attributes are defined by the HTML standard and provide universal functionality such as styling, accessibility, and scripting.List og global attributes: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes -->
