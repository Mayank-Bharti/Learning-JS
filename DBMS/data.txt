1. Data: data is stored in the form of bits/bytes.Collection of raw bytes.

e.g.: Images or int: collection of bytes

2. Data has no meaning. When data is processed or interpret then we get some meaning which is called information.

e.g. A person has a business => we have to do presence of business in social media.

Marketing company=> posts business details in FB, Insta, Linkedin => Social media with more likes have more publicity to do.

Data=> Like count => 4 byts integers => Process => Conclusion => Instagram has more likes.=> Decision making => focus on Insta.

Data is a new oil nowadays.Data is very important for Businesses also.

Databases : Electronic place/system where data is stored st that it is easily accessed, managed, and Updated.

DBMS:Manages two things: 1. DB(to store data)  2. Set of programs: access, add, update, delete.
Store and manage and efficient.

DBMS is act as interface between DB and user.

3. Why to make complex system ? Why not file system?

Earlier file system is used but its accessibility is not there.
There are lots of problem in it.

1. Data redundany and inconsistency.
2. Difficult in accessing data.
3. Data isolation (data in different format .txt or .jpg, etc)
4. Integrity problem: constraints:balace not  less 1000 is given but user wants to change limit which is again difficult and programmer again write code.

5. Atomicity problem : like transactions.
6. Concurrent Access anomalies: we can request from multiple things like debit and phone concurrently.
7. Security problem.
